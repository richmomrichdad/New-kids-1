  <h1>Protect Kids from Becoming Content</h1>
  <p>Florida is home to countless family influencers — but kids appear in videos with no protections or payouts. Let’s fix that.</p>

  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🎥 Kids filmed from birth during vacations, meltdowns, or even staged “pranks” — and videos live online forever for profit.</li>
    <li>Parents often go viral, often without consent or compensation for the children in the footage.</li>
    <li>Florida is a hotspot for these channels — but we have no laws protecting these minors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Florida Needs A Law</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Why is this harmful?</strong> Kids grow up without real privacy or control over their identity and earnings.</li>
    <li><strong>How do other states handle this?</strong> Washington’s HB 2032 and Illinois require revenue sharing and removal rights at adulthood.</li>
    <li><strong>Why now?</strong> Social media family content is booming — and Florida is at the epicenter.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>What used to be private family memories — like vacations, milestones, or silly moments at home — are now monetized content. Children are often filmed crying, being disciplined, or caught in vulnerable situations that live forever online.</p>

  <p>These moments are used to generate views, grow influencer accounts, and turn children into revenue streams — often without their consent, understanding, or any guarantee of financial compensation. Some influencers even stage dramatic “pranks” or encourage sibling conflict for clicks.</p>

  <p>This is happening right here in Florida, where many high-profile creators live or film — yet there are currently no laws protecting these children.</p>
