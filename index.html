  <h1>Protect Kids from Becoming Content</h1>
  <p>Florida is home to countless family influencers ‚Äî but kids appear in videos with no protections or payouts. Let‚Äôs fix that.</p>

  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>üé• Kids filmed from birth during vacations, meltdowns, or even staged ‚Äúpranks‚Äù ‚Äî and videos live online forever for profit.</li>
    <li>Parents often go viral, often without consent or compensation for the children in the footage.</li>
    <li>Florida is a hotspot for these channels ‚Äî but we have no laws protecting these minors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Florida Needs A Law</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Why is this harmful?</strong> Kids grow up without real privacy or control over their identity and earnings.</li>
    <li><strong>How do other states handle this?</strong> Washington‚Äôs HB‚ÄØ2032 and Illinois require revenue sharing and removal rights at adulthood.</li>
    <li><strong>Why now?</strong> Social media family content is booming ‚Äî and Florida is at the epicenter.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>What used to be private family memories ‚Äî like vacations, milestones, or silly moments at home ‚Äî are now monetized content. Children are often filmed crying, being disciplined, or caught in vulnerable situations that live forever online.</p>

  <p>These moments are used to generate views, grow influencer accounts, and turn children into revenue streams ‚Äî often without their consent, understanding, or any guarantee of financial compensation. Some influencers even stage dramatic ‚Äúpranks‚Äù or encourage sibling conflict for clicks.</p>

  <p>This is happening right here in Florida, where many high-profile creators live or film ‚Äî yet there are currently no laws protecting these children.</p>
